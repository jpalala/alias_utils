Configure MongoDB

These packages configure MongoDB using the /etc/mongodb.conf file in conjunction with the control script. You will find the control script is at /etc/init/mongodb.conf.

This MongoDB instance will store its data files in the /var/lib/mongodb and its log files in /var/log/mongodb, and run using the mongodb user account.

Note

If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you will need to modify the access control rights to the /var/lib/mongodb and /var/log/mongodb directories.
Controlling MongoDB
Starting MongoDB

You can start the mongod process by issuing the following command:

sudo service mongodb start

You can verify that mongod has started successfully by checking the contents of the log file at /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log.
